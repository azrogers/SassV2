The sniper commands relate to a SASS game to play with your real-life friends in person in the world. Basically, the idea is to spot the other participants in public before
they spot you. To do so, you first need to designate a specific channel for this game, using the [[sniper channel]] command (an admin needs to do this). Then simply send an
image every time you spot someone, tagging the people you spotted, and SASS. So, for example, if you spotted James, Brad, and Nick, you'd send a picture and tag 
@James @Brad @Nick @Scripted Automated Speech System.
